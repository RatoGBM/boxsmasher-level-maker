Python script for converting 32x18 pngs into levels for [boxsmasher](https://github.com/rollerozxa/boxsmasher) by ROllerozxa.

Rellies on [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) image library for Python.

! This script is not a perfect tool, customization needs to be added manually, and output must be manually copied each time.

## Running

Currently you will have to run the `converter.ipynb` notebook.

pngs should be RGBA

Red (255,0,0,255) are the boxes

Green (255,0,0,255) is the throwBoundary

Blue (255,0,0,255) is the solid terrain

## TODO

Proper converter still under construction.

A JavaScript version and plugins for pixel art editors might come later.
